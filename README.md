# Vehicle-Sensor-Malfunction


The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force a piston to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing the vehicle down. The benefits of using an APS instead of a hydraulic system are the easy availability and long-term sustainability of natural air.

This is a Binary Classification problem, in which the affirmative class indicates that the failure was caused by a certain component of the APS, while the negative class indicates that the failure was caused by something else.

### Solution Proposed 
In this project, the system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurized air that is utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The datasets positive class corresponds to component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class corresponds to the failure of components not related to the APS system.

The purpose here is to reduce the cost due to unnecessary repairs. So it is required to minimize the false predictions.
## Tech Stack Used
1. Python 
2. FastAPI 
3. Machine learning algorithms
4. Docker
5. MongoDB

## Infrastructure Required.

1. AWS S3
2. AWS EC2
3. AWS ECR
4. Git Actions
5. Terraform

## How to run?
Before running the project, make sure MongoDB is installed in local system with Compass since it is being used for data storage. AWS account is needed to access the service like S3, ECR and EC2 instances.

http://localhost:8080/train

```

### Step 7. Prediction application
```bash
http://localhost:8080/predict

```

## Run locally

1. Check if the Dockerfile is available in the project directory

2. Build the Docker image
```
docker build --build-arg AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID> --build-arg AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> --build-arg AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<AWS_DEFAULT_REGION> --build-arg MONGODB_URL=<MONGODB_URL> . 

```

3. Run the Docker image
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 <IMAGE_NAME>
```

To run the project  first execute the below commmand.

```
mongodb+srv://
```
windows user

```
MONGO_DB_URL=mongodb+srv://
```

Linux user

```
export MONGO_DB_URL=mongodb+srv://
```

then run 
```
python main.py
```
